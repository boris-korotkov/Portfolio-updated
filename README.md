1. ####  Descriptive analytics

   The very first experience with Python happened in the Data Science Program back in 2018 at University of Toronto.  The team of four people enjoyed the time together of slicing and dicing the Canadian Car Collision dataset (1994-2014) in Foundation of Data Science course project:

   `Toolset: Python, including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn`

2. #### Machine Learning

   The next project was created by team of three students in the same Data Science Program.  The objective was to predict the house price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) was used for this project.  The Project was a training camp for features engineering, data pipelining, Regression models selection, hyperparameters tuning and optimization. The final effort was an experiment with a simple Neural Network which gave the best result and got the submission rank of 1,340 out of 4,632, e.g. within top 30%.
